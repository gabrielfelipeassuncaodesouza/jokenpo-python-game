# Jokenpo 🪨 📄 ✂️

A simple jokenpo game made with basic concepts about Python and structured programming

I started developing this game when I've started learning how to program in python. I had experiences with other languages as C, for example. So, that was a very good moment of my journey learning a new programming language

I pretend to improve this game in the future, like add a ranking system and make the game beaultiful. So, if you wanna contribuite, feel welcome.

Enjoy :smile:
